        <p> On top of my college degree, I have done a 3 month Web Design and Development 
            Professional Certification program at eCornell University in August 2020.
            To still enhance my software engineering skills, currently, I am also enrolled in 
            Springboard's Software Engineering Career Track bootcamp program, which is an intensive 
            9 months long program.
